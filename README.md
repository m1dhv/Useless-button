### Project Description
[The Useless Button is a playful web-based project designed to do exactly what the name suggests ‚Äî provide a button that, when clicked, does nothing useful at all. Instead, it makes random sounds and features some fun eyeball animations that follow your mouse around!]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Are you tired of buttons that actually do things? Ever wished for a button that brings absolutely no value to your life? The Useless Button is here to fulfill your desire for a button that‚Äôs truly pointless.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[This project solves the "problem" by presenting a button that plays random sounds and includes eyeballs that track your every move. With a sidebar menu that can be toggled, it‚Äôs a web page as useless as it is entertaining.]
